# Tic-Tac-Toe #

This program originally started out as a way to further learn TDD (Test Driven Development), 
however it quickly grew to have its own GUI and Theme system. 

## Design ##

The original specs of this program involved a EventHandler and InputHandler, however in creating the GUI I found
no need for them.

The original Class Diagram:

## Assets and Copyright ##

All artwork belongs to whomever made them. I found them on Google. The only thing that belongs to me is the code.
